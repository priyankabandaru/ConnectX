Errors:

Error in inBounds() functionality : This functionality fails if the width is outside the bounds and height is within the bounds.i.e.,if I give (4,4) for a board of (5,5) it works without bug but if I give(6,4) for the same board it fails.Since a single variable inside is overwritten in the function and is returning once.There must be a else if condition to overcome this error.
